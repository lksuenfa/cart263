Artist statement

'Oscar needs glucagon' is a simple point and click game where the user simulates the basic steps of the emergency response necessary to care for an hypoglycemic episode. By introducing theoretical knowledge of this medical condition and building empathy with Oscar through story, we hope that the user will remember potentially life-saving information more easily. This project was inspired by a personal reflection on the lack of engagement of patients with scientific information which are often presented in a serious yet extremely bland and generic way. And we hope the user will enjoy this game as a refreshing change from more orthodox ways of presenting scientific information.
