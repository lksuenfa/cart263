# Secret Hunter exam

Hunter x Hunter by Yoshihiro Togashi is an iconic adventure manga and anime which has marked my childhood. The story follows Gon Freecss, a young boy would leaves his native island to become a Hunter like his missing father. His aim is to find him using the many privileges provided by the status of a Hunter professional license.

In "Secret Hunter Exam", the player embodies a freshly licensed Hunter who needs to learn the secret practice of Nen in order to acquire the full Hunter status. We want this game to recreate a specific scene in Hunter x Hunter where Gon discovers his aura type through water divination. It is a turning point in the anime since it represents the very beginning of training oneâ€™s abilities.

Using a custom JSON data file and several libraries like p5.js and ml5 Handpose to emphasise on a dynamic interactive storytelling, we aim to create an immersive experience for the player.
