# Secret Hunter exam

Artist statement

Hunter x Hunter by Yoshihiro Togashi is an iconic adventure manga and anime which has marked my childhood. The story follows Gon Freecss, a young boy would leaves his native island to become a Hunter like his missing father. His aim is to find him using the many privileges provided by the status of a Hunter professional license.

In "Secret Hunter Exam", the player embodies a freshly licensed Hunter who needs to learn the secret practice of Nen in order to acquire the full Hunter status. We want to recreate a specific scene in Hunter x Hunter where Gon discovers his aura type through water divination. It is a turning point in the anime since it represents the very beginning of training oneâ€™s abilities. Although we initially wanted to role play the exact same scene as the episode of the anime, we were worried that the lack of context might be too confusing to a user who does not know the background story of the anime. Thus we modified the text a bit in order to explain what is Nen and what it is its purpose before starting the water divination process.

Using a custom JSON data file and several libraries like p5.js and ml5 Handpose to emphasise on a dynamic interactive storytelling journey, we aim to create an immersive experience for the player. It is more an exploration of storytelling through code than a game per se as it does not have a specific goal to achieve other than living through the experience of finding out one's aura type.

Design-wise, we wanted to go with a simple minimalistic feel with geometric shapes and bright colours reminiscent of the colour palette of the HxH scene in question. It meant to convey the feelings of seriousness amidst a bright and innocent atmosphere, foreshadowing the challenges to come. The typeface DotGothic16 by FontWorks Inc. which recreates the feel of pixel fonts from old video games was chosen to hint at the actual age of HxH manga series which was published in 1998. All meant to reinforce the connection to childhood memories.
