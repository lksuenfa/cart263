      <h3>DO NOT DISTRIBUTE</h3>

      <h4>Ingredients</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="top-secret redacted">Moonshine (80-85%) – 1 liter </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="top-secret redacted">
            Bitter wormwood (dried) – 100 gr
          </span>
        </li>
        <li><span class="top-secret redacted">Anise seeds – 50 gr </span></li>
        <li><span class="top-secret redacted">Fennel seeds – 50 gr </span></li>
        <li>Lemon balm – 5 gr (for shade)</li>
        <li>
          <span class="top-secret redacted">Hyssop – 10 gr (for shade) </span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Preparation:</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Put wormwood, anise, and fennel into a fermentation vessel—glass
          bottle or jar. Seal it and leave for
          <span class="top-secret redacted"> 2 weeks </span> in a dark place
          with room temperature. Shake it once a day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the obtained infusion along with herbs into a distillation still
          of classic design (with a heating spiral). Additionally, you can use a
          thumper. Add 3.5 liters of water to lower infusion’s ABV to 18-20%.
          Distilling stronger liquid is explosion-hazardous!
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="top-secret redacted">
            Heat up the distillation still on medium heat and then decrease the
            heat so that the prepared absinthe could drop instead of spouting.
          </span>
          The obtained distillate should be cold downstream. Active heating
          might cause the herbs to burn thus spoiling the taste with bitterness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on the quality of moonshine the first 30-70 ml of the return
          yield (2-7% of the initial volume) should be gathered separately.
          <span class="top-secret redacted">
            This fraction is called “foreshots”—a poisonous substance with bad
            smell.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          The middle run (or “hearts”) can be gathered until ABV drops to 38-40%
          or the liquid becomes cloudy. After that, you can finish distillation.
          During distillation, the distillate changes its color from clear to
          gold but with no cloudiness. This is normal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="top-secret redacted">
            In order to make a green absinthe from moonshine, you need to pour
            off 50% of the obtained beverage into a separate vessel, add lemon
            balm and hyssop (you can also add 0.3-0.5 gr of wormwood for extra
            bitterness),
          </span>
          stir, and seal. Leave it for 1-2 days in a dark place. Shake it once a
          day. Seal the second part of the absinthe.
        </li>
        <li>
          Filter the colored infusion through cheesecloth, squeeze well, and
          then mix with the clear part.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dilute the homemade absinthe with water till you get the desired
          <span class="top-secret redacted"> ABV—65-75%. </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Bottle the absinthe for storing and seal it.
          <span class="top-secret redacted">
            Leave it in a fridge or cellar for at least 15-20 days before
            drinking it.
          </span>
          This stabilizes and enhances its taste.
        </li>
      </ol>
